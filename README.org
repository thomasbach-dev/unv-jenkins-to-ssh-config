* Generate SSH configuration file from Jenkins job output

  This is very specific to a project I am currently working in. What it
  does is to read a configuration file in the format:
  
  #+begin_src yaml
    hostname: my-jenkins.example.com
    port: 8181
    ssh-config: /home/thomasbach-dev/my-ssh-config
    path-selector: job-one
    path-map:
      job-one:
        /job/path/to/workspace/one
      job-two:
        /job/path/to/workspace/two
  #+end_src

  It then connects to the specified server, fetches the console output
  of the latest completed build, extracts machine names and IPs and
  writes these information into a nicely formatted SSH
  configuration. You simply have to include that configuration and can
  use short names to connect to the machines.

** Help message of the script

   To get a feel of the options and flexibilty of the command:
   #+begin_example
     Usage: jtsc [-c|--config-file FILE] [-s|--path-selector SEL] [-n|--job-num NUM]
                 [-p|--prefix STR] [-a|--append]
       Generates a SSH configuration file from a Jenkins job.

     Available options:

       -n,--job-num NUM         The job number to fetch from Jenkins. (Defautlts to

       -p,--prefix STR          Prefix to put in front of host
                                name. (default: "unv-")
